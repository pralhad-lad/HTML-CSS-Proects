    <h2>Hinduism reformer</h2>
    <p><b>Swami Vivekananda(12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902),</b>born Narendranath
        Datta was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious
        teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.He
        was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the
        Western world.He is credited with raising interfaith awareness and
        bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion in the
        late nineteenth century. Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha
        family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age
        towards religion and spirituality. At the age of 18 he met
        Ramakrishna, later becoming a devoted follower and sannyasin
        (renunciate). After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda toured the
        Indian subcontinent as a wandering monk and acquired first-hand
        knowledge of the often terrible living conditions of Indian people
        in then British India. In 1893 he traveled to the United States
        where he participated in the Parliament of Religions in Chicago.
        Here he delivered a famous speech beginning with the words: "Sisters
        and brothers of America ..." introducing the ancient Hindu religious
        tradition to Americans and speaking forcefully about the essential
        unity of all spiritual paths, and the necessity of embracing
        tolerance and renouncing fanaticism.The speech made an
        extraordinary impression. One American newspaper described him as
        <b>"an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at
            the Parliament"</b>.After the great success of the Parliament,
        Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States,
        England, and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu
        philosophy. He founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the
        Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern
        California),which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies
        in the West. In India, he founded the Ramakrishna Math, which
        provides spiritual training for monastics and householders, and the
        Ramakrishna Mission, which provides charity, social work and
        education.Vivekananda was one of the most influential
        philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India, and the
        most successful missionary of Vedanta to the Western world. He was
        also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform movements and
        contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.He
        is now widely regarded as one of the most influential people of
        modern India and a patriotic saint. His birthday is celebrated in
        India as National Youth Day.

    <h2  class="biography-heading">Early life (1863–1888)</h2>
    <h3>Birth and childhood</h3>
    <p>
        Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren) in a Bengali Kayastha family
        in his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta,the capital of British India,
        on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival.He was one of nine siblings.
        His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court.
        Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family
        and became a monk at age twenty-five.His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife.
        The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape
        his thinking and personality.
        Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities
        such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman.
        He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks.Narendra was mischievous and restless as a child,
        and his parents often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, <b>"I prayed to Shiva for a son and
            he has sent me one of his demons".</b>
